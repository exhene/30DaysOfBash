# IntroToBash

Bash (short for "Bourne-Again SHell") is a command-line shell and scripting language used primarily in Unix and Linux operating systems. It is the default shell on most Linux distributions and macOS systems. Bash allows users to interact with the operating system and execute commands through a command-line interface. It provides a powerful set of features, including file globbing, piping, and command substitution, and also supports scripting with variables, loops, conditionals, and functions. Bash scripts can be used to automate tasks, configure system settings, and perform complex data processing operations. Overall, Bash is a powerful tool for both interactive use and automation in Unix and Linux environments.
